## 🔍 Demonstration Results

**Example Evaluation Output:**
```
📊 Quality Metrics Results:
========================================

**Generated Recommendations:**
1. **Poor Overall Quality (HIGH Priority)**: Implement gradient-based attribution techniques
2. **Poor Selectivity (HIGH Priority)**: Add sparsity constraints to explanation method
3. **Low Consistency (MEDIUM Priority)**: Add consistency regularization to training
4. **Poor Prediction Agreement (HIGH Priority)**: Consider different attribution techniques

## 🎯 Model Improvement Strategy

### Immediate Improvements (Based on Metrics)

**For Poor Selectivity:**
```python
# Add sparsity regularization
loss = prediction_loss + λ * sparsity_penalty(explanations)
```

**For Poor Consistency:**
```python
# Add consistency regularization
consistency_loss = correlation_penalty(similar_molecule_explanations)
total_loss = prediction_loss + α * consistency_loss
```

**For Poor SAR Alignment:**
```python
# Incorporate known pharmacophore patterns
sar_loss = pharmacophore_alignment_penalty(explanations, known_patterns)
total_loss = prediction_loss + β * sar_loss
```

### Architecture-Based Improvements

**High Selectivity Models:**
- Use attention mechanisms
- Implement bottleneck architectures
- Add sparsity constraints

**High Consistency Models:**
- Increase regularization
- Use ensemble methods
- Add batch normalization

**SAR-Aligned Models:**
- Incorporate chemical features
- Use knowledge-guided training
- Add domain-specific constraints

## 📈 Quality Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Quality Level | Action Required |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | **Excellent** | Minor fine-tuning only |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | **Good** | Targeted improvements |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | **Moderate** | Significant changes needed |
| 0.0 - 0.4 | **Poor** | Major revision required |
